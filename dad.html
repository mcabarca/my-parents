Founded in the late colonial period, this small town's development was influenced by its strategic location in the fertile valleys and its role in local agriculture. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, San Luis a la Loma witnessed significant social and economic changes, particularly during the Mexican Revolution, which impacted many rural communities in Guerrero. The town's population has traditionally been involved in farming, with a focus on crops like corn and beans, and more recently, has seen shifts due to broader economic changes in Mexico. Despite these transformations, San Luis a la Loma retains much of its traditional character, with local customs, festivals, and a strong sense of community continuing to define its cultural landscape.";
