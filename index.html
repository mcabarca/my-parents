        My family was born in Mexico, born and raised in Guerrero where both parents were separated by a river and a bridge between their villages. Both of my parents were raised around the same area but never met until they came to the states. My moms grandma owned a disco in which my dad would go perform. Although my parents could have met  during their time in mexico due to a river that was separating the two villages instead of meeting each other in mexico my parents met through an aunt that used to babysit my older sister that got closer to my dad not knowing that he was going to be her moms future husband.
